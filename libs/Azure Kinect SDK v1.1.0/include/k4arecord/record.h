 * \param path

 *
 * \param device
 * The Azure Kinect device that is being recorded. The device handle is used to store device calibration and serial

 * \param device_config

 * Streaming does not need to be started on the device at the time this function is called, but when it is started
 * it should be started with the same configuration provided in \p device_config.
